# Tableau Industry Insights Dashboard
A comprehensive financial analysis dashboard comparing the financial performance and key metrics of companies across 8 industries (tech, pharmaceutical, real estate, oil & gas, retail, insurance, food, and electricity). Utilizing a [dataset](https://github.com/zzarif/Tableau-Industry-Insights-Dashboard/blob/main/companies/companies_data.csv) containing financial information for 1500 companies, the dashboard offers a wide range of visualizations and metrics, including market capitalization distribution, year-over-year growth, price-to-earnings ratios, geographical distribution, and more. By comparing and contrasting the performance of companies within each sector, the project uncovers valuable insights for businesses, investors, and other stakeholders.
